# Introduction


### Who am I?
My name is  Arã Araújo and I'm 25 years old. I'm originally from Brazil and I'm majoring in Software Engineering. I love to play sports specially soccer.

### What do I like to program?
I've been programming a lot lately for mobile devices. I started with few projects in Swift, but now I'm mainly working with Flutter. Flutter is the best solution I have found for hybrid development.
